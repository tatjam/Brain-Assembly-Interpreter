# Brain**** Assembly Interpreter

##This software is meant to be run using this: https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/

# ·Complete:
---
Every BF program should run on this interpreter, it allows nested brackets (Experimental :P)
Scheweigi's assembly simulator is quite slow (On purpose), so even a simple program will take time to run

# ·How to use:
---
Simply place your program code at the 	<DB "..."  ; Your program here> line.
If your program uses input, place it in the 	<DB "Hey!"   ; Your input here> line

# ·Safety:
---
Virtual memory is not wrapped around!!! If you get out of it, by either way, your program will behave strange. Warranty voids if you do so...

# ·Issues:
---
As Scheweigi's simulator only allows 255 bytes of RAM, your brain**** programs, and their input is limited to about 32 bytes. 
I could optimize the interpreter, but the maximum program space i believe i could get is about 42 bytes...

Output is only one line and limited to 24 characters (Quite a lot actually!)

# ·How is this useful?
---
I believe it has no use. :P
I just made it to test my skills, this can be used tough as a basecode for other Brain**** interpreters, remember, assembly is the step before language machine... 


Cheers!
